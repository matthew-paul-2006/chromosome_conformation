# Chromosome conformation capture

A collection of scripts for analysing chromosome conformation capture datasets

## Decay correction
In this script I take my interaction matrices, and correct for the interaction decay with distance between points. Using a model for decay, the intra chromosomal interactions are normalised, while independently the inter chromosomal interactions are normalised, based on overall interchromomsal interaction frequency.
